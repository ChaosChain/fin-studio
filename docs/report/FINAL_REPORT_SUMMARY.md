// Extracts different content based on analysis type
case 'sentiment': return { sentiment, confidence, trends, riskFactors, strategy };
case 'technical': return { signalProbability, priceTargets, tradingSignals };  
case 'macro': return { indicators, policyStance, recessionProbability };
case 'insights': return { summary, keyPoints, recommendations, marketOutlook };
```

### 2. **Quality-Based Display**
```typescript
// Only show detailed analysis for consensus-verified agents
{analysis.actualAnalysis && analysis.consensus && (
  <div className="mt-3 p-3 bg-blue-50 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-blue-500">
    <h5 className="font-semibold text-blue-800 mb-2">üìà Market Sentiment Analysis for {symbol}:</h5>
    // ... actual AI content display
  </div>
)}
```

### 3. **Progressive Disclosure**
```typescript
// Load detailed content on demand
const fetchDKGDetails = async () => {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/dkg/nodes?taskId=${analysisResult.taskId}`);
  setDkgNodes(data.nodes); // Triggers content extraction and display
};
```
